<p>Original Article: <a href="http://www.world-of-dawkins.com/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1994-12religion.htm">Dawkins on Religion</a>

<p>Firstly, let me say that I respect Dawkins’ intelligence and experience with regards to evolutionary science.  In addition, his observations are insightful and religious people would do well to consider carefully what he is saying.  However, his observations do not exhaust the subject of religion, and because of this we could make the following comments:

<p><b>Analysis of Dawkins’ Position</b>
<ol>
<li>Dawkins proposed defeater of theism and the Bible is actually built on quite a narrow base, as it only addresses the overlap between the Biblical account of the origin of life and the theory of evolution, and does not include other significant <a href="http://www.leaderu.com/truth/3truth01.html">philosophical</a>, <a href="http://www.leaderu.com/everystudent/easter/articles/yama.html">historical</a> and <a href="http://www.leaderu.com/truth/3truth04.html">experiential</a> aspects of the question whether God exists or not.
<li>Dawkins fairly rapidly stretches this proposed defeater across a number of religious issues, without analysing in depth these issues that have been drawn into the discussion.  This means that his discussion can be superficial at times.
<li>Part of the process of progressing towards a greater understanding of truth and reality includes exploring rationally valid alternative views, yet Dawkins does not adequately discuss alternative views in his article before saying that the full-blown neo-Darwinian theory of evolution is true.  Even if the theory of evolution is true, it is always worthwhile openly recognising that our knowledge is finite.  A person who carefully discusses alternative views without making disparaging statements about them is much less likely to fall into the trap of rigid fundamentalism.
</ol>


<p><b>Implication of Evolution</b></br>
So, what I would like to propose is to identify the core implication of evolution with regards to Biblical theism, which can be stated as follows:
<ul>
<li>The theory of evolution provides a framework for explaining the origin of life which differs from the description of the origin of life in the first two chapters of the Bible in terms of time frame and physical mechanism.
</ul>

<p><b>Evolution: An Open System</b></br>
One might be tempted to include within this implication the clause that life originated without any input from God.  However, the theory of evolution does not demand a closed system – in fact all evolutionary proposals for the origin of life hold that the development of life has been an open system:
<ul>
<li>Asteroids from outer-space have contributed to the extinction of certain groups of species;
<li>Physical objects have been utilised as tools which have enhanced survival and resulted in greater intelligence;
<li>Non-physical concepts, such as circles and numbers, have been recognised and incorporated into our developing technical prowess and biological survival toolkit.
<li>Non-physical basic moral principles (such as that killing without justification, sexually abusing children and racism are destructive behaviours that should be avoided) have been discovered which result in greater chances of survival, while also following a gradient towards an emotionally more satisfying lifestyle.
</ul>

<p>It should be noted that none of these entities are themselves an output of evolution itself (physical objects, the concept of a circle and moral principles would have existed whether we existed and utilised them, or whether we had never existed at all), yet they have contributed to the development of life as we know it.  What this means is that evolution itself does not close the door to the existence of God or any input from God.  God may not have been physically involved at all, just like a black hole may never have physically contributed to the development of life here on earth.  However, evolutionary theory does not exclude existence of black holes because of this, and neither does it exclude the existence of God by definition.  Evolutionary theory, on its own, does not make any specific statement for or against the existence of God – it simply proposes a framework for describing the physical development of biological life on earth.

<p><b>The Existence of Differing Accounts</b></br>
At this point, let us return to the overlap in subject that exists between evolutionary theory and the first two chapters of the Bible.  Firstly, it should be noted that there are actually three accounts of creation within these chapters – a summary statement in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&passage=Genesis+1%3A1&version=NIV">Genesis 1:1</a>, a structured account found in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=Genesis+1%3A2-2%3A3">Genesis 1:2-2:3</a> and an account focused on humans in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=Genesis+2%3A4-25">Genesis 2:4-25</a>.  Due to their different emphases, these accounts do not immediately match each other and in particular the methods of creating in the two more detailed accounts are markedly different.  Thus, some process of harmonisation is required.  What this means is that if science identifies a fourth account of the origin of life, then this does not automatically disqualify all aspects of the Biblical accounts.  It is a case of investigating more closely what the differences really are.  If differing accounts of the origin of life really provided a major argument against the existence of God, then the Bible itself is not devoid of this problem.  

<p>Evolutionary theory certainly does provide a framework for the origin of life which challenges aspects of the accounts in the Bible.  However, it does not eliminate the possibility of the existence of God and Him being the cause of the universe – what it provides is an naturalistic framework of physical mechanisms for the origin of life, but this does not mean that God could have never had interacted with life at any point in time.  Also, the theory of evolution does not disqualify the summary statement found in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&passage=Genesis+1%3A1&version=NIV">Genesis 1:1</a>, since this summary statement does not identify any specific physical mechanism for the creation of the universe.

<p><b>God’s Involvement with Creation</b></br>
To determine whether God was actually involved in the creation of the universe and perhaps in the origin of life, we would have to identify whether there is any necessity for Him to be involved and if so, identify how He might have been involved.  As Dawkins discussed, cosmologists have identified an unexplainable mystery with regards to why the universe exists, which would certainly identify the need for an explanation.  God can certainly <a href="http://www.leaderu.com/truth/3truth11.html">enter into the picture</a> here as the ultimate Cause for the universe's existence.  Furthermore, science has revealed that our universe exists because of a delicate balance of finely-tuned initial conditions and physical constants, and the best explanation for the existence of a real universe with this particular selection of parameter values is the existence of a rational being who chose to bring this specific universe into existence.  

<p>While Dawkins commented that the cosmologist’s description of God does not correspond to the Biblical one, it can also be said that it is natural that cosmologists will only describe what is necessary to explain the cause of the Big Bang and the existence of physical laws.  This does not mean to say that God cannot have more qualities than what physicists identify as being absolutely necessary to explain the question that they are dealing with.  For example, it is reasonably clear that human life is associated with a set of moral values, but it seems unnecessary for cosmologists to describe any moral nature to the cause required for the physical Big Bang even if morality is a feature of the character of God.  In fact, full scientific accounts for an efficient cause of the universe based on string theory are not available, and string theory itself remains in the realm of philosophy rather than as a verifiable scientific field.

<p>However, the universe and physical laws are not the only entities that need an explanation.  Our world also consists of non-physical entities such as circles, numbers, laws of logic and moral principles.  All these would have existed even if we had never been here to discover them, and their existence does call for an explanation.  One can certainly proceed without any explanation for them, but this avoids a potential mystery.  Certainly, human beings are the only known biological organisms to have the intellectual capacity to discover their existence.

<p>While the theory of evolution as described by Dawkins does not need the physical input of a being such as God, one can also observe that this does not mean that the physical process of evolution could not benefit from the input of a rational being.  Thus, the theory of evolution and the existence of God do not contradict each other – at the very least evolution and God are independent concepts, rather than being mutually exclusive, and need to be considered separately, while at the same time evolution can only serve to gain from the existence of God.  

<p>However, there are aspects of life which do point towards the involvement of an intelligent designer.  The genetic diversity that is observed amongst living organisms is possible through the existence of a basic genetic operating system, which includes a DNA alphabet consisting of four letters, fixed length codewords of three letters that deterministically encode for amino acids and error-checking mechanisms that are operate during the transcribing and translating processes.  This basic operating system is virtually universal for all living organisms, from unicellular organisms all the way to human beings.  The assumption that this basic operating system has not changed, or evolved, is essential for understanding life beyond the genetic horizon, otherwise, evolution would disappear into a fog of unknown genetic processes.  However, the fact that this operating system has not been subject to evolutionary forces is quite surprising.  The universality of this operating system and the assumption that it has remained constant is best attributed to an intelligent designer such as God who planned for the existence of this genetic operating system and sustains its existence throughout all living organisms.  Another subject of growing interest is the cause of consciousness, first-person self awareness and rationality within human beings.  A number of philosophers see great difficulty in science being able to provide a physical explanation for these properties of human nature, while it seems a natural step to reason that these properties have been given to us by a conscious, rational designer of the universe.

<p>The Biblical concept of God is that He is a rational, moral Being, and the Bible primarily describes His involvement with human beings as rational biological organisms, rather than being intimately involved with biological organisms which do not have advanced intellectual skills.  Based on this definition, one could expect that if God existed then intellectual organisms would be able to consider the possibility of His existence, in a way that is not dissimilar from the ability of rational beings to recognise the existence of non-physical entities such as circles and moral principles, and even engage with Him at a common level.  This has parallels with human beings having the capacity to understand genetics and being able to interact with that process.

<p><b>Miracles and the Bible</b></br>
Dawkins made the statement that there is little evidence for <a href="http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/miracles.html">miraculous accounts</a> in the Bible such as the Resurrection.  Two things can be said about this: firstly, the creation account itself might not be literally true, but these other accounts may be true.  They are not directly tied together.  Also, accounts that tell of Jesus being raised to life are based on eye-witness accounts, which is different from the account provided for creation.

<p>Secondly, this does depend what type of evidence one is looking for – one can be asking for the wrong type of evidence.  Fundamentally, the Resurrection is not an event which can validated scientifically, just as the fact that Nero was Emperor of Rome cannot be validated scientifically, in the sense that one can use genetics and the laws of physics to prove or disprove the Resurrection or Nero’s status.  Rather, this event must be analysed from philosophical and historical perspectives.  Certainly, Christians hold to the common belief that humans do not rise naturally from the dead.  However, if God does exist, then the Resurrection is certainly possible.  The <a href="NTDocuments.html">sheer abundance of manuscripts</a> and their <a href="NTAuthorship.html">early dating</a> drastically reduce the likelihood that these accounts are mythical.  Given the geographical diversity of manuscripts and their authors, it is furthermore not irrational for a person to hold that the Resurrection did occur.  It would have been worthwhile for Dawkins not to gloss over this issue.  

<p>Also, Dawkins does not seem to have studied the issue of <a href="BiblicalProphecy.html">prophecy in the Bible</a>.

<p>With regards to the Adam and Eve issue, the theory of evolution seems to be able to support the possibility that the human race converged at a particular point, as it supports convergence in other situations.  People who believe in theistic evolution would hold that it was at this point that God became actively involved in human history (since evolution is not a closed system), so one cannot assume that a well-educated, yet religious, person does not believe in a fairly literal account of the convergence of the human race, which can be referred to using Biblical terminology.


<p><b>Inheriting Religion</b></br>
It is certainly true that beliefs can be passed on down through the generations, but this is not necessarily an argument against the existence of God.  It mainly identifies that human nature has a tendency to accept the beliefs of those around us, which is equally true of scientists.  It challenges us to critically examine our own beliefs, and consider alternative perspectives on our beliefs.  Dawkins is making what is know as the genetic mistake – mistaking the truthfulness of a belief as being determined by how you received that belief.  For example, you may have read the statement <em>Sex is fun</em> as graffiti on the walls of the toilets at school and had the mechanics of sexual intercourse explained to you behind the school shed, rather than formally receiving this knowledge from the sex-education teacher.  However, just because you did not receive this information through an official education system does not automatically discredit any particular aspect of the knowledge that you gained.  Similarly, your parents may have instilled a certain moral value into your behaviour as compared to your coming to know it when you grasped the full implications of morality through a professor of ethics at a university.  Your source of this moral value does not determine whether that principle is basically correct or not.  The truthfulness or fallacy of that belief must be determined through other means.  Certainly it is possible that a belief we have acquired from our parents may be partially true.

<p>At the same time, Dawkins’ analysis of the propagation of religious beliefs is a little simplistic, as history has demonstrated that it is not uncommon for humans to consider and accept religious and philosophical beliefs that their parents did not hold.  Sometimes this flux in beliefs may take a few generations to be noticeable, but certainly strict inheritance of parental beliefs does not appear to be what actually occurs (Christianity would never have got off the ground if this was the case, and neither would widespread acceptance of the theory of evolution).  

<p>Beliefs tend to be maintained if there is minimal access to alternative views, or if a society places significant stigma or consequences on departing from the beliefs accepted by the society.  Unfortunately, this can also occur in scientific circles, where there is a certain stigma associated with exploring spiritual concepts.  Also, geneticists in general can have a tendency towards atheism because they focus heavily on evolutionary origins for life, rather than placing the issue of the naturalistic origin of life in appropriate relation and context with other issues such as philosophical aspects of the theism, historical relevance of religion, morality within society and one’s personal spiritual well-being.  Once again, the challenge is not necessarily to identify that people can have the tendency to hold the beliefs that their particular society or peer group holds, but rather to be personally willing to explore other beliefs that warrant consideration.

<p><b>Faith: The Intellectual Cop-Out</b></br>
To Dawkins, religion is founded on faith, which is simply an intellectual cop-out.  By this, Dawkins means that unless a belief is self-evident (like the belief that I exist), is directly observable (such as the fact that an external, physical world exists) or can be scientifically proven (such as the existence of an electron which has negative electric charge), then it is intellectual laziness and/or obstinate blindness which leads a person to maintain a particular belief.  This is a serious charge, and there is a ring of truth in it.  Any reasonable person will recoil when such an allegation is made regarding a belief, and will proceed rather cautiously before openly claiming to hold the belief in question.

<p>However, it is easy to conclude a little too hurriedly that such a challenge is totally devastating to any belief that is not generated by science.  There is no doubt that science has generated huge amounts of knowledge of the world around us, and for that we are justly thankful.  However, if we are to consider the scientific approach itself, we begin to realise that Dawkins has not made the final statement with regards to what should be believed and how those beliefs are justified.  In effect, Dawkins believes that it is only through the scientific approach that true understanding and rational beliefs can be formed, yet in itself this statement is self-refuting, because it cannot be scientifically proven.  To say this in another way, the philosophy on which science is based (such as the use of observation, the need for repeatability and the test of falsifiability) cannot turn to science itself for justification.  While the scientific approach can be rationally justified, it must be accepted without scientific proof.

<p>Another example is the existence of basic moral values, such as principles that killing without justification, sexual abuse of children and racism are truly wrong.  Dawkins contends that his advocation of evolution does not mean that moral values such as these should be abandoned, which means that he holds that they do still actually exist and hold for human beings.  However, once again these moral values fail to pass the Dawkins test in that they cannot be intrinsically proven by science.  In the case of both examples, the philosophy of science and the existence of morals, Dawkins is asking us to accept their validity without scientific proof, so in effect he is asking us to have faith in their rationality.  Thus, Dawkins needs to be careful with regards to the beliefs that he seeks to dismantle, as the same criticism undermines his position and views.  To summarise, there is more to life and our understanding of reality than science itself, and Dawkins fails to recognise this fact.

<p>With regards to Dawkins comments on respecting religious beliefs and rituals, he is primarily faulting the principle of blind tolerance.  However, just because one is tolerant of people’s beliefs does not mean to say that as a society we should allow religions to get away with being involved in an activity that is fairly clearly breaking a basic moral principle.  Tolerance does not need to be unlimited, so I would agree with Dawkins’ position here, and I am sure many other well-educated Christians would also agree.


<p><b>Agnosticism: God, Santa Claus and Fairies</b></br>
The difficulty with regards to Dawkins statement here is that it does not compare the significance of these beliefs.  Even if Santa Claus did exist, then there are no philosophical implications for my life – he is not potentially the cause of anything significant I experience in life, and he is not going to change anything.  In comparison, there is significance in the belief of a personal God who is the cause of the universe, yet at the same time is willing to have major spiritual input in our lives.

<p>Also, there are very few people who claim to believe in the reality of Santa Claus and who say that Santa Claus has had a major impact on their lives.  In contrast, quite a number of people throughout history and at the present time claim that by consciously accepting the belief in a personal God, their lives have been changed for the better.  This means that belief in God has had greater impact on human beings, and should be considered more seriously in comparison with a belief in Santa Claus, otherwise there is a risk of trivialising an issue that has major historical and personal significance.


<p><b>Improbability of God</b></br>
Dawkins argument regarding the improbability of the existence of God once again primarily focuses on evolutionary origins of life, and it is difficult to see how one can evaluate the probability of God’s existence from this.  Just because one cannot find any necessity for a particular entity within a certain process does not define the probability of its existence – it merely comments on the probability of the entity being involved with that particular process.  Similarly, it  is difficult to see how one can evaluate the probability of a black hole existing based on evolutionary theories.  If we were to look at the origin of the universe, the existence of physical laws, the existence of non-physical entities and the widespread belief in the existence of God and associated religious experience, the probability of the existence of God becomes non-negligible again, if we are still speaking in terms of trying to determine some probability value for the existence of God.
<p>
Actually, it would be more accurate for Dawkins to say that he and a number of other people find it difficult to believe that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent God actually exists, rather than saying that there is a very low probability that such a God exists.  Defining God?s existence in terms of probability implies that there is some statistical test that can be applied to validate these characteristics of God, when in fact no such test exists.  Instead, these characteristics of God are theological and philosophical statements, so they need to be analysed as such.  In particular, saying that it is difficult to believe in such a God suggests that there could be a philosophical problem with the claim that God does have these characteristics.  There is such a problem – the problem of the existence of suffering and evil.  If God was omnipotent and all-loving, then one would think that He would swiftly put an end to all the suffering that we observe in the world, or even never have allowed it in the first place.  This philosophical problem has been the focus of many philosophers, but the Christian response to this problem includes the following aspects:
<ul>
<li> The reality of evil and suffering means that objective moral values exist.  Otherwise, an action or event cannot be defined as evil.  However, for moral values to be truly objective, their origin must transcend construction by the human mind and instead they must have their foundation in the transcendent mind of God.  Thus, the objective reality of evil is only coherent if God exists.
<li> God desires to preserve our freedom of choice, and to achieve this He must allow us the freedom to do evil.  
<li> Throughout history, God has warned us of the consequences of doing evil.  If we choose to ignore these warnings and follow an evil course, in the course of time we will be able to understand the true nature of evil.  Subsequently, when we choose to do what is good it is because we know for ourselves that it is the correct choice.
<li> God?s solution to suffering was to commit Himself to our experience in the person of Jesus Christ, and to take the full consequences of evil upon Himself.
<li> God has a definite plan to end suffering.
</ul>

<p><b>Considerations Regarding Evolution</b></br>
Some issues to consider with regards to evolution:
<ul>
<li>Apparent age phenomena in relation to special creation
<li>If God does exist, He was potentially the only rational Being in existence during the process of the development of life.  If He does have the ability to communicate with human beings, then He would be able to inform us of what actually occurred.
<li>If the Bible shows itself to be God’s method of communicating with us in other respects (such as historical reliability, prophetic power and ability to describe the character of God to us), then we can start to take more seriously the Bible as a whole.  This does not mean to say that we reject concepts within the theory of evolution, but it does mean that we treat the concepts addressed in the Bible as having greater significance.
</ul>
These issues, amongst others, mean that it is valuable recognising our ever finite knowledge with regards to the origin of life.

<p><b>Personal Conclusion</b></br>
Many people would say that the creation account for the origin of life is not the key factor in their accepting the belief that God exists, as in all reality it does not directly affect their daily life.  Most would say that they were initially attracted to Christianity by first knowing a reasonable, open-minded Christian whose lifestyle demonstrated admirable character qualities that Christianity promoted.  As they went on to read through the Biblical records of Jesus Christ, they personally found them to be authentic and that by consciously accepting Christian beliefs and actively seeking a spiritual relationship with God, their lives have been changed for the better.  This is what usually gives the belief in God personal credibility.  At the same time, the vastness and beauty of the universe quite often inspires one to contemplate the reality of God.  To what extent God was physically involved in the development of life is not as big an issue as Dawkins makes it out to be.
