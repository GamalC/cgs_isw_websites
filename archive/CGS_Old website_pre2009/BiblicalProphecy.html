One of the great proofs that the Bible claims to use to validate God's existence and authority of the Bible is the test of prophecy.   For example, in Isaiah, God says:
<p><em>I make known the end from the beginning,<br>
from ancient times, what is still to come.</em><br>
Isaiah 46:10
</p>
and in the New Testament Jesus says, regarding a prophecy that he has made about his ascension:
<p><em>I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.</em><br>
John 14:29
</p>
Of course, naturalistic reasons can be constructed for explaining away the prophetic power of the Bible, such as the prophecies were recorded after their fulfillments, that scribes embellished accounts as they copied them or that the prophecies would have happened in some manner anyway, and it is simply a case of attaching the historically closest match to demonstrate fulfillment of the prophecy.  However, once the prophetic time frames become significant where they reach beyond the Old Testament (most significantly pointing towards events surrounding the life of Jesus Christ) or into modern times, and there are factors associated with the prophecies that are beyond the control of individuals, the evidence that prophecy provides becomes quite significant.  In fact, much of the Bible is prophetic writings, but a compilation of fulfilled prophecies are recorded here.
<ol>
<li>Abraham was told that the time that the Hebrews were enslaved in Egypt was predicted to be four hundred years.
<p><em>Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.  But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.</em>
Genesis 15:13,14</p>

<p><em>The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.  The Lord had made the Egyptians favourably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians….  Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt was 430 years.  At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the Lord’s divisions left Egypt.</em>
Exodus 12:35,36,40,41</p>

<li>Predictions regarding the kingdom of Israel and its kings.
<ul>
<li>God’s prediction that the kingdom of Israel would be divided after Solomon between one of his sons and one of his officials.
<p><em>So the Lord said to Solomon, “Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates.  Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime.  I will tear it out of the hand of your son.  Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.</em>
1 Kings 11:11-13</p>

<p>Fulfilment of this prediction is recorded in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&passage=1+Kings+11%3A26-12%3A24&version=NIV">1 Kings 11:26-12:24</a>.</p>

<li>Micaiah’s prediction that Ahab would be killed in battle
<p><em>Then Micaiah answered, “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the Lord said, ‘These people have no master.  Let each one go home in peace.’”…</em>
<em>The king of Israel then ordered, “Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king’s son, and say, ‘This is what the king says:  Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.</em>
<em>Micaiah declared, “If you ever return safely, the Lord has not spoken through me.”  Then he added, “Mark my words, all you people!”</em>
2 Chronicles 18:16,25-27</p>


<p><em>But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armour.  The king told the chariot driver, “Wheel around and get me out of the fighting.  I’ve been wounded.”  All day long the battle raged, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening.  Then at sunset he died.</em>
2 Chronicles 18:33,34</p>
</ul>

<li>Isaiah predicted that the Babylonians would return to Israel and take people as captives to Babylon.
<p><em>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord:  The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your fathers have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon.  Nothing will be left, says the Lord.  And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood, that will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.</em>
2 Kings 20:16-18</p>

<li>Jeremiah predicted that the Israelites would be captive in Babylon for 70 years.
<p><em>This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.  But when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation, the land of the Babylonians for their guilt,” declares the Lord.</em>
Jeremiah 25:11,12</p>

<p><em>The land enjoyed its Sabbath rests; all the time of its desolation it rested, until the seventy years were completed in fulfilment of the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah.</em>
2 Chronicles 36:21</p>

<li>Isaiah said that God designated Cyrus to allow the rebuilding of Jerusalem:
<p><em>[The Lord]…who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd and will accomplish all that I please;  He will say of Jerusalem, “Let it be rebuilt,” and of the temple, “Let its foundations be laid.”</em>
<em>“This is what the Lord says to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of to subdue nations before him and to strip kings of their armour, to open doors before him so that gates will not be shut….</em>
<em>I will raise up Cyrus in my righteousness: I will make his ways straight.   He will rebuild my city and set my exiles free, but not for a price or reward, says the Lord Almighty.”</em>
Isaiah 44:28</p>

<li>Predictions about the life of Jesus:
<ul>
<li>Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem
<p><em>But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.</em>
Micah 5:2</p>

<p><em>So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.  He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.  While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.  She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the in.</em>
Luke 2:4-7</p>

<li>Jesus’ ministry in Galilee
<p><em>In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honour Galilee of the Gentiles, by the way of the sea, along the Jordan – The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.</em>
Isaiah 9:1,2</p>

<p><em>After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.  “The time has come,” he said.  “The kingdom of God is near.  Repent and believe the good news.”</em>
Mark 1:15</p>

<li>The dates for the start of Jesus’ ministry and his death are predicted in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=Daniel+9%3A25-27&x=12&y=7">Daniel 9:25-27</a>.
<li>Jesus suffering, death, burial and resurrection are predicted in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=Isaiah+53">Isaiah Chapter 53</a>.
<li>Scenes at the cruxificion of Jesus are foretold in the Psalms, including his cry of abandonment (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&passage=Psalms+22%3A1&version=NIV">Psalms 22:1</a>), the taunts of the Jewish leaders suggesting that Jesus save himself (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&passage=Psalms+22%3A7%2C8&version=NIV">Psalms 22:7,8</a>) and the Romans soldiers nailing him to the cross and dividing his clothes amongst themselves (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=Psalms+22%3A16-18">Psalms 22:16-18</a>).

</ul>

<li>Predictions that Jesus himself made
<ul>
<li>His own suffering and death
<p><em>He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and the he must be killed and after three days rise again.  He spoke plainly about this.</em>
Mark 8:31</p>
<li>His ascension
<p><em>You heard me say, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’  If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is great than I.  I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.</em>
John 14:29</p>
<li>The sign for Christians to escape from Jerusalem
<p><em>When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near.  Then let those who in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city.</em>
Luke 21:20,21</p>
<p><em>Not one Christian perished in the destruction of Jerusalem.  Christ had given his disciples warning, and all who believed his words watched for the promised sign… After the Romans under Cestius had surrounded the city, they unexpectedly abandoned the siege when everything seemed favourable for an immediate attack.  The besieged, despairing of successful resistance, were on the point of surrender, when the Roman general withdrew his forces without the least apparent reason.  But God’s merciful providence was directing events for the good of His own people.  The promised sign had been given to the waiting Christians, and now an opportunity was offered for all who would, to obey the Saviour’s warning.  Events were so overruled that neither Jews nor Romans should hinder the flight of the Christians.  Upon the retreat of Cestius, the Jews, sallying from Jerusalem, pursued after his retiring army; and while both forces were thus fully engaged, the Christians had an opportunity to leave the city.  At this time the country also had been cleared of enemies who might have endeavoured to intercept them.  At the time of the siege, the Jews were assembled at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Tabernacles, and thus the Christians throughout the land were able to make their escape unmolested.  Without delay they fled to a place of safety – the city of Pella, in the land of Perea, beyond Jordan.</em>
The Destruction of Jerusalem, The Great Controversy.

</ul>

<li>Predictions about Paul’s ministry and imprisonment:
<ul>
<li>Jesus’ prediction about Paul’s ministry to Gentiles, kings and the Jews:
<p><em>But the Lord said to Ananias, “Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel.  I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.”</em>
Acts 9:15</p>

<p>Fulfilment of this prediction can be found in the book of Acts Chapters 9-28.</p>

<li>Paul’s prediction that the storm would destroy the ship, where the ship would be wrecked on an island, but that no one would be killed:
<p><em>After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: “Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.  But now I urge to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed.  Last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul.  You must stand trial before Ceasear; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.’   So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that I will happen just as he told me.  Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island.</em>
Acts 27:12-27</p>


<p>Fulfilment of this prediction can be found in the rest of Acts <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=Acts+27">Chapter 27</a> and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=Acts+28">Chapter 28</a>.</p>
</ul>
 
<li>Based on understanding Biblical prophecies in Daniel (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=Daniel+7%2C8">Chapters 7,8</a>) and Revelation (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=Revelation+13">Chapter 13</a>), Christian predictions have historically included:
<ul>
<li>Reunification of Europe
<li>Global dominance of the United States
</ul>

<p>An interpretation of these prophecies is that it foretells an alliance between a fundamentalist, ring-wing administration within United States and the Roman Catholic church within Europe with the express goal of achieving world peace.  However, as history has demonstrated, religious-political systems have the potential of becoming oppressive, which is what Revelation predicts will unfold in the future.</p>
