<h1>Guidelines for the CGS Computer Officer</h1>

<h2>Responsibilities</h2>

<p>The CGS computer officer is responsible for maintaining all the technical aspects of the society with respect to mailing lists, websites and printing.  Specifically, these responsibilites include maintaining the following:</p>
         <ol>
	   <p><li><a href="#r1">Mailing list</a></li></p>
	   <p><li><a href="#r2">Printing term cards</a></li></p>
	   <p><li><a href="#r3">CGS website</a></li></p>
	   <p><li><a href="#r4">ISW website</a></li></p>
	   <p><li><a href="#r5">ISW Schedule</a></li></p>
	 </ol>
<p>This document gives guidelines on each of these responsibilities.</p>

<h2><a name="r1">Managing the Mailing list</a></h2>

<p>The CGS mailing list: <pre>soc-cgs@lists.cam.ac.uk</pre> is hosted by hermes.cam.ac.uk, the university mail server.  A userid and password is required for hermes, which can be obtained from the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/">Computing Services</a>.  Once logged into hermes, the mailing list can be managed by following the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/docs/leaflets/g90/">instructions for managing group email</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="r2">Printing Term Cards</a></h2>

<p>One of the primary ways of advertising CGS events is through the distribution of term cards.  These cards contain key information about the society as well as the events for the current university term.  Information regarding the events is formulated by the CGS committee, and once this is available the new term card can be produced.</p>

<p>The term card file is in MS Word format so that it can be easily distributed, read and modified by other members of committee.  A copy of the card is located in the directory storing the CGS web site.  The term cards can be printed at <a href="http://www.stag.org/">St. Andrews the Great Church</a>, which has generously offered to supply the card need for printing the term cards.  Their phone number is 01223 518218.</p>

<p>The easiest way of printing the term cards is to lay each A4 side of the term card side-by-side [B1T1][T2B2] (where T refers to the top and B refers to the bottom of the landscape-oriented page) which together forms an A3 sheet.  This is then copied twice with 70% reduction using 1->2 sided copying onto both sides of an A4 sheet of card.  The sheet can then be cut into two A5 sections, and folded to form a mini-booklet.</p>


<h2><a name="r3">Maintaining the CGS Website</a></h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/societies/cgs/">CGS website</a> is fairly simple, consisting a small collection of static HTML pages.  Mostly this involves updating the webpages of events, but once a year the page giving contact details for committee members needs to be updated.  The website is hosted using the Group Filespace service at <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/">Computing Services</a>, which has <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cambuniv/socinfo/web/">instructions for using this group filespace</a>.</p>

<p>In particular, the files are located on the shared.pwf.cam.ac.uk FTP server.  A userid and password needs to be obtained for this server and perrmission given to read and write files to the CGS directory.  The following FTP commands are the most commonly used:
<pre>
help
cd SOC/cgs/WWW
ls
put file.htm
get file.htm
</pre>
</p>

<h2><a name="r4">Maintaining the ISW Website</a></h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/societies/cgs/isw/">ISW Website</a> is located as a subdirectory of the <a href="#r3">CGS directory</a> on shared.pwf.cam.ac.uk.  It consists of a number of static HTML pages, and like the CGS website it is principally the events page that needs to updated each year.  The only major difference is that the ISW website contains a form which can be used to contact members of the ISW committee.  The email addresses for two of the hidden inputs for this form need to be updated each year:
<pre>
name="toText" value="email1@cam.ac.uk"
name="ccText" value="email2@cam.ac.uk"
</pre>
where these two email addresses are for the people who will receive messages posted from the ISW website.  The form is submitted to a mailtool utility located at http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cucgs/isw/mailtool/mailtool.php.  This is a standard PHP mailtool that should not need to be changed.</p>

<h2><a name="r5">Maintaining the ISW Schedule</a></h2>

<p>One of the major contributions of ISW is to organize a large number of volunteers to meet new international students at the Cambridge train and coach stations.  This requires keeping a schedule of the time commitments of the volunteers, and for a couple of years this has been stored using an on-line database.  A MySQL database has been created, together with the appropriate PHP interface, and is hosted by <a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/">SRCF</a>.  The computer officer needs to <a href="mailto:membership@srcf.ucam.org">register with SRCF</a> to obtain a username and a password, and must also be given permission to read and write files to the CGS directory.</p>

<p>Users of the ISW Schedule fall into two categories: superusers which can modify the contains of the database, and users who can only have minimal access to the database.  The schedule itself can be viewed by anyone at the following URL: <a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cucgs/isw/schedule/restricted/view/limited.php">http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cucgs/isw/schedule/restricted/view/limited.php</a>.  Accounts can be created using <a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cucgs/isw/schedule/restricted/lib/create-account.php">http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cucgs/isw/schedule/restricted/lib/create-account.php?uid=<var>youruserid</var></a>.  NOTE that the person creating these accounts must be logged into the database to created this new accounts.  Also, usernames for superusers need to be added to the list in the is_superuser function in the file ~/cucgs/public_html/isw/schedule/restricted/include/connect-mysql.php.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/societies/cgs/isw/schedule/">login page</a> for superusers is located in the isw/schedule/ subdirectory of the <a href="#r3">CGS filespace</a> on shared.pwf.cam.ac.uk.  The database allows a person 15 minutes of inactivity before requiring them to re-login.</p>

<p>On the whole, the database should not need to be modified much from year-to-year.  The contents of the database can be cleared by superusers using the PHP pages within the schedule.  The biggest changes that need to made are the dates for ISW, which need to be changed manually in the following files:
<pre>
restricted/add/arrival-form.php
restricted/edit/arrival.php
restricted/edit/own.timeslot.php
restricted/edit/user.timeslot.php
restricted/include/decode.php
restricted/sign-up/sign-up.php
restricted/view/limited/coach.schedule.php
restricted/view/limited/index.html
restricted/view/limited/limited.php
restricted/view/limited/own.schedule.php
restricted/view/limited/train.schedule.php
restricted/view/limited/view.php
restricted/view/limited/whole.schedule.php
restricted/view/coach.schedule.php
restricted/view/limited.php
restricted/view/own.schedule.php
restricted/view/train.schedule.php
restricted/view/view.php
restricted/view/whole.schedule.php
</pre>
To make the database more user-friendly, a PHP page for automatically updating these dates would be useful.
</p>
