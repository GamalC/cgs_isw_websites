<h3><A> Easter Term 2014 Events </A></h3>

<h3><a name="connectE14_3"><b>Saturday, 31st May, 10:30am: CGS Connect</b></a> </h3>
<p>
The topic of our Connect meeting is "Can academic work become an idol?".

Do we sometimes value our academic work more than God? What is
challenging about setting our priorities right, especially during busy
times? Come along and join us at CGS Connect this Saturday for a
discussion of academic work as an idol and how it relates to our
relationship with God. We will look at some Bible passages, and think
about how to focus on God in our work and honour Him with it. Light
refreshments will be provided.
</p>
<p>
Venue: Sidney Sussex College Chapel 
</p>
<h3><a name="connectE14_4"><b>Saturday, 14th June, 10:30am: CGS Connect</b></a> </h3>
<p>
Join us for a session of worship, music, and prayer. </p>
<p>
In his classic "Knowing God", Dr Jim Packer writes that "people who know 
their God are before anything else people who pray." When we pray with 
others, we can be strengthened as we trust and commit ourselves to the 
Lord who Hears. Come along and join us at CGS Connect this Saturday for 
a prayer and worship session. Join us in prayer for the Graduate 
Community in Cambridge and be an encouragement for each other in songs 
of worship. We have selected some of the finest Christian songs and 
hymns, which will be accompanied by piano, flute and guitar music.
</p>
Venue: Latimer Room, Clare College
</p>

<h3><a name="connectE14_1"><b>Saturday, 3rd May, 10:30am: CGS Connect</b></a> </h3>
<p>
The topic of our connect this Saturday is "A Place to Ask Your Hard Questions".
</p>
<p>
It’s a new term, a new season and CGS has a new leadership committee,
so we thought it fitting to try something a little different with this
Connect. We want CGS to be a community of postgraduates committed to
excellence in Christian scholarship and to being salt and light within
the university. We also want CGS to be a welcoming place for both
believers and those who are exploring Christian faith. In being a
place for believers to not have to pretend they have it all figured
out, we wanted to give room for even the most mature believer to talk
about any hard questions or stumbling blocks in their faith journey.
We would be heartbroken if the demands of the secular university
resulted in any Christian student abandoning their faith rather than
growing in it. We’ve designed this Connect for anyone, including
seekers, to come and ask questions. We can’t promise to answer all of
them in one morning, but we do want to begin and we hope you can join
us. If you have questions you’d like to talk about, but can’t come on
Saturday, please feel free at any time to get in touch with a CGS
committee member or CGS staff worker, Paula Puckett at
ppuckett@go.mailsvc.com. For those that can join us, there will be
space to ask questions out loud or by submitting them on paper. If
you’d like to ask a question ahead of time, please email one of us.
Please remember that the person of Jesus can withstand the hardest
questions and biggest obstacles.
</p>

Time: 10.30am - 12:00pm

Venue: Latimer Room, Clare College

Venue: St Andrew the Great
</p>


<h3><a name="connectE14_2"><b>Saturday, 17th May, 10:30am: CGS Connect</b></a> </h3>
<p>CGS Connect: Using Personal Narrative and Story-telling in our Witness</p>
<p>
“Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.”  (1 Pet. 3:15)  Please join us this Saturday morning for refreshments, fellowship, and a practical workshop on becoming more effective in communicating both the story of Jesus in the world and the story of His work in our lives.   We want CGS to be a place where we’re growing in commitment to one another and to the Kingdom in Cambridge, and to being salt and light in the University as a community of Christian scholars.

Venue: Latimer Room, Clare College

<p>
Connect is happening this Saturday (1st March) and we'd love you to join 
us!  Come to the Godwin Room in Clare College at 10:30am for a chance to 
chat (with snacks!), then we'll be looking at

"Speaking their language?  Cross-cultural outreach in the post-grad 
world"
Different cultures and backgrounds ... different life experiences ... 
maybe significantly different worldviews.  We can be daunted when we 
meet students from countries other than our own - how can we hope to 
communicate the Christian gospel?  Bartow Wylie of Friends International 
will look at this with hope at Connect this coming Saturday.  If you'd 
like to share that hope, come and join us.

We'll aim to be done by 11:30am.
</p>
