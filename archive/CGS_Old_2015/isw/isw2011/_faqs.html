</li>

<li><a name="faq1">How do I get to Cambridge?</a><br>

<p>For those of you arriving by plane, transportation from the airports is
possible by both train and bus.  Travelling by bus to Cambridge is probably
the most convenient, as there are direct <a
href="http://www.nationalexpress.com/">National Express Airport</a> (formerly known as
Jetlink) buses almost twice every hour from <b>Heathrow</b> Central Bus Station or Terminal 4 (coaches number 717, 787 and 797, <b>&pound 33</b>
return, good for 3 months; &pound 25.50 one-way; the journey takes 2 hours and
50 min), <b>Gatwick</b> (717 and 797, <b>&pound 35.50</b>, &pound 29.50, 4 hours) and
<b>Stansted</b> (717 and 797, <b>&pound 12</b>, &pound 10, 50 minutes) Airports.</p>


<p>The twice-hourly <a
href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/CambArea/trains/">trains</a> from the King's
Cross station in central London, which is connected to Heathrow and Gatwick
by underground (go to King's Cross/St Pancras underground station), costs
&pound 18 one-way and takes 50 minutes.  Travelling by underground with
heavy luggage is troublesome.</p>

<p>The bus and train stations in Cambridge have taxi ranks; expect to pay
&pound 3- &pound 5 for taxi to college. [<a href="#top">Top</a>]

</p></li>

<li><a name="faq2">OK...I am at the bus/train station, what's next?</a><br>

<p>If you arrive to Cambridge by bus or train between 9am and 9pm (21
September to 1 October), you will be greeted at the station by a member of
the welcome team who will give you some useful information about Cambridge
and direct you to a taxi to take you to your college.</p>

<p>At the station you will also be invited to the <a
href="events.html">International Student Welcome Events </a> where you can
meet old and new postgradute students and members of the welcome team. 
These events are a great opportunity to make friends in Cambridge. [<a
href="#top">Top</a>]

</p>
</li>

<li><a name="faq3">I would like to arrive in Cambridge earlier than my
college expects, where can I stay?</a><br>

<p>It is best to arrive on the date requested by your college in order to
guarantee accomodation.  However, if you decided to arrive earlier, there
are a number of hostels, hotels, and guest houses where you can reserve a
room on your own.  The <a href="http://www.visitcambridge.org">Visit Cambridge</a> and <a
href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/tourism/">Cambridge Evening News Tourism</a> websites gives full details.  Guest houses and Bed &
Breakfast rooms in Cambridge at this time will be around &pound 30 per night
for a single, though some may be available at a bit less.

Here are a few places in the City Centre.</p>

<li><a name="faq4">My College is not able to provide accomodation! What do I do?</a><br>

<p>For long term accommodation please contact the <a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/accommodation/">University
Accomodation Service </a>. They will best be able to help you find a place
to live. Also, there is the <a
href="http://www.linkhousetrust.com/">Link
House</a>, which is a house for international students. Please call them
at +44 1223 561202 or <a href=mailto:"wardens@linkhousetrust.com">email</a>.

<p>Other places to look are the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wwwnews?grp=ucam.adverts.accommodation">ucam.adverts.accommodation</a> newsgroup and the <a href="http://www.brettward.co.uk/canb/">Cambridge Accommodation Noticeboard</a> (not connected with the University).  There can be pitfalls in renting accommodation privately however, so it's best to talk to the University Accommodation Service first.</p>

<li><a name="faq5">HELP!! I have too much luggage! How can I get
everything I need to Cambridge?</a><br>

<p>No need to fret!  You can ship over items before you leave and most
colleges will save your things until you arrive.  Check with your college by
calling the Porter's Lodge at your <a
href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cambuniv/colleges.html">college</a>.  If you are
planning to have some of your luggage shipped separately, arrange this in
advance and make sure the company knows you are shipping personal effects,
since some companies refuse to do this for customs reasons.  <i>Clearly mark
all packages with your name and the address given by your college for
shipping purposes</i>. [<a href="#top">Top</a>]

</p></li>


<li><a name="faq6">What do I need to know about immigration?</a><br>

<p>You should receive a letter from your college confirming that you have
been accepted onto a course and have sufficient funding for its entire
duration.  You need to bring this letter with you, as it will be required at
the airport passport control checkpoint.  Check with your embassy for any
visa/entry certificate requirements and if you need any medical
certificates.  Be sure to bring any medicines you need with you, as well as
copies of the prescriptions for medicines and for glasses and contact
lenses, in case you need replacements soon after you arrive.  Some
pharmaceutical products may not be available in the same brands here, so it
may be wise to bring extra supplies to use initially before you can discover
the equivalents. [<a href="#top">Top</a>]

<li><a name="faq7">What is the cost of living in Cambridge?</a><br>

<p>Depending on the country you are coming from, the cost of living may be
quite different from what you are used to.</p>

<li><a name="faq8">Is it easy to cycle in Cambridge?</a><br>

<p>Cycling in Cambridge is safe as long as you are careful, and it can be quite fun too. 

There are plenty of good bike shops in Cambridge, and the ones further from
the centre of the town are often slightly cheaper.  You can hire a bike, but
you'll probably prefer to buy one.  If so, don't delay!  Many cycle shops
sell out of second hand bikes when the students arrive.  It's better to look
out for adverts for second hand bicycles on notice boards around the
University (also see <a
href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wwwnews?grp=ucam.adverts.forsale">online
adverts</a>), or even to buy a cheap new one from, for example, Mike's Bikes
on Mill Road.  Prices range from &pound 65+.  You could also try a 'car
boot' sale-see local newspapers for details...  Be prepared to haggle over
the price of second hand bikes. You will also need a strong lock (preferably
a "D" lock- &pound 15 at bike shops, &pound 10 at Argos), as bikes left
unlocked in Cambridge are soon stolen.  It is also dangerous to cycle without
lights after dark, so make sure you have a good set of them too.

<li><a name="faq9">Something else...?</a><br>

<p>If you have another question not covered here, you can contact the International Student Welcome team at our <a href="about.html">home page</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could try checking the <a
href="http://www.gradunion.cam.ac.uk/forum/">Graduate Union
forum</a> where question may already have been answered, or other graduates may be able to
help. For all sorts of aspects about living in Cambridge city (rather than
specifically student things), the cam.misc newsgroup discusses anything and everything (and lots of unrelated things too).  It has a <a
href="http://www.cam.misc.org.uk/">database of frequently asked questions</a>, and you can read the discussion either <a href="news:cam.misc">in your newsreader program</a> or <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=cam.misc">through Google.</a></p>
